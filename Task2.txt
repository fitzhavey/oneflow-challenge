The sample code appears to invite a user to a shop if they haven't already been invited.

Some errors that I can see are:
    - line 1 should begin "module.exports" instead of simply "exports"
    - line 3 should be "params.id" instead of "params.shopId" to get the value

Code that could cause unexpected behaviour:
    - line 32 sends an error result in response to an Http 200 status
    - line 24 appears to push the "inviationResponse.body.invitationId" only if it's already in the array

Ways in which the sample could be refactored:
    - line 13 appears to update a field which was used to query which seems unnecessary.
    - line 18 has the beginning of a nested function that is difficult to follow and could use functions defined elsewhere for readability and easier testing
    - errors seem to be send inconsitantely as either "res.status(XXX).send(..)" [line 21] or "res.status.(XXX).json(..)", this could cause confusion

Along with refactoring the code in the above way it would be useful to probe the functions with console logs to see exactly which resources are being reused. 
It would also help to ensure each code block is clearly seperated with one purpose per block to mimising time spent bugfixing.
